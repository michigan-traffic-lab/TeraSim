<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# Introduction

## About
This project aims at providing a microsim simulation environment based on SUMO. With APIs provided, users can easily build vehicle model and apply test on the simulation platform.

## Code Structure

- docs: extra documentations on this repo
- examples: examples of using terasim to run driving simulations of vehicle models
- terasim: main contents
  - envs: uses functions from 'vehicle' and create an integrated driving environment with multiple vehicles in which the given autonomous vehicles are tested
  - logger: tracks the information in the environment
  - measure: measures to take along with simulations
  - network: transforms the maps to SUMO API to be used by simulator
  - vehicle: contains the 'sensors', 'controllers' and 'decision_models' of a vehicle, and uses 'factories' to combine all three parts and creat a vehicle.
  - configs.py: contains configurations
  - simulator.py: applies SUMO to our environment and run simulations
  - utils.py: utility functions
- setup.py: required packages to run this repo

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

# Installation
The project is developed and tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Therefore, we recommend running the following process on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. You are recommended to create a virtual environment to install the simulation platform.

## Prerequisites

Recommended environment:
- Python 3.10
- SUMO 1.19

Minimum versioned environment:
- Python 3.10
- SUMO 1.19

We recoomend using Conda to create a virtual environment and install the terasim.
```
conda create -n $env_name$ python=3.10
conda activate $env_name$
```

The simulation requires map files in SUMO format (.net.xml). Please refer to '/examples' for detailed guidelines.

## Download terasim
- Download from Github: `git clone https://github.com/michigan-traffic-lab/TeraSim.git`

## Install terasim
Navigate to the directory of the project (`cd TeraSim`), and then

- Normal install: `pip install .`
- Development install: `pip install -e .`

## Commonly Seen Errors

After the installation, if you encounter the following error and the SUMO gui does not show up:
```bash
libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast
X Error: code 2 major 152 minor 3: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation).
```
You can run the following command to fix the error (using Anaconda):
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge libstdcxx-ng
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
# Usage

The package consists of multiple classes, including simulator, environment, vehicle and controller. for basic usage, we only need the Simulator class and the Environment class. For example, to build a simulation with one dummy AV running in a 3lane highway, we neeed the following script:

```python
from terasim.simulator import Simulator
from terasim.envs.env import BaseEnv
from terasim.logger.infoextractor import InfoExtractor
import terasim.vehicle
from terasim.vehicle.factories.vehicle_facotory import VehicleFactory
from terasim.vehicle.sensors.local_sensor import LocalSensor
from terasim.vehicle.controllers.high_efficiency_controller import HighEfficiencyController
from terasim.vehicle.vehicle import Vehicle
from terasim.vehicle.decision_models.dummy_decision_model import DummyDecisionModel
from terasim.vehicle.decision_models.idm_model import IDMModel


class ExampleVehicleFactory(VehicleFactory):

    def create_vehicle(self, veh_id, simulator):
        """Generate a vehicle with the given vehicle id in the simulator, composed of a decision model, a controller, and a list of sensors, which should be defined or customized by the user.

        Args:
            veh_id (_type_): vehicle id
            simulator (_type_): simulator (sumo)

        Returns:
            Vehicle: the contructed vehicle object
        """
        sensor_list = [LocalSensor(simulator)]
        # decision_model = DummyDecisionModel(mode="random")  # mode="random" "constant"
        decision_model = IDMModel() # Use IDM model to control the vehicles
        control_params = {
            "v_high": 40,
            "v_low": 20,
            "acc_duration": 0.1,  # the acceleration duration will be 0.1 second
            "lc_duration": 1,  # the lane change duration will be 1 second
        }
        controller = HighEfficiencyController(simulator, control_params)
        return Vehicle(veh_id, simulator, sensors=sensor_list,
                       decision_model=decision_model, controller=controller)

env = BaseEnv(
    vehicle_factory = ExampleVehicleFactory(),
    info_extractor=InfoExtractor
)
sim = Simulator(
    sumo_net_file_path = 'examples/maps/3LaneHighway/3LaneHighway.net.xml',
    sumo_config_file_path = 'examples/maps/3LaneHighway/3LaneHighway.sumocfg',
    num_tries=10,
    gui_flag=False,
    output_path="./output/0",
    sumo_output_file_types=["fcd_all"],
)
sim.bind_env(env)
sim.run()

```

In the script, we build the environment, the simulator, and bind them together. Then we run the simulator, the sumo interface will show up. After clicking the "run" button in the sumo-gui, the simulation will run with one autonomous vehicle(CAV) and multiple background vehicles(BVs).
